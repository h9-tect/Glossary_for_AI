-------------------

> Discrete Mathematics
- Definition: An algebraic operation that takes two sequences of numbers or two sets of homogenous number of elements (e.g., $u_n$ and $v_n$) and returns a scalar obtained by multiplying corresponding entries (or elements), and then summing the resulting products.
- Formula (uses $Riemann's Sum Notation$): $\sum_{i=0}^{n} u_i v_i = u_0 v_0+u_1 v_1+u_2 v_2+...+u_{n-1} v_{n-1} +u_n v_n$ 

> Euclidean Geometry (Vector maths)
- Definition: Recall, vector $(u)$ and vector $(v)$ are intersecting vectors at a point $(p)$, then it follows that the sum of the products of their corresponding vector components is known as the "dot product", and following the proof, it can be stated that this is equivalent to multiplying the vector norms together with cosine the inscribed angle between them.
- Formula: u.v = $[u_0, u_1, u_2].[v_0, v_1, v_2]$ = $u_0 v_0 + u_1 v_1 + u_2 v_2$ = $||u|| * ||v|| * cos(a)$; where (<a) is the inscribed angle between vector $(u)$ and vector $(v)$ in an Euclidean vector-space.

> Usages:

- Finding the inscribed angle (<a) between 2 intersecting vectors, formula: m(<a) $= acos(u.v/(||u|| * ||v||))$; where u.v can be evaluated using the Riemann's sum formula (Trigo./Physics).
- Finding whether 2 intersecting vectors are orthogonal, formula: $u.v = ||u|| * ||v|| * cos(PI/2)$ = ZERO (Geometry).
- Finding projection vectors, formula: "the vector projection of $u$ onto $v$" $proj_{v}^{u} = (||u|| * cos(a)) * (v/||v||) = (u.v / ||v||^2) * v$; where $(||u|| * cos(a))$ is the length of the triangle base, and $(v/||v||)$ is the unit vector form (normalized) of $v$.

on the graph, the function is curved in terms of the substrate function.

> Formula:
- If u is a dummy (arbitrary) variable, it follows that if
$ƒ(u)$ is differentiable at the point $u = g(x)$ and $g(x)$ is differentiable at $x$, then the composite function $(ƒ ∘ g) (x) = ƒ(g(x))$ is
differentiable at $x$, and: $(ƒ ∘ g)′(x) = ƒ′(g(x)).g′(x)$ or $d(ƒ ∘ g)(x)/d(x) = [df(u)/ d(u)] . [dg(x)/d(x)]$ in _Leibniz's notation_.

> Usages:
- Quick-finds the derivative of a composite functions, if both functions are known (though you can still differentiate $(ƒ ∘ g)(x)$ directly).
- Complex analysis of a function in terms of other functions (Application of multiple functions on the same object).

> Steps to prove:
1) Envision the following in an Euclidean vector-space $V_I$: 
      - A dummy variable (u).
      - A function $f(u) = 3u^2+1$.
2) Envision the following in another Euclidean vector-space $V_{II}$:
      - A dummy variable (x).
      - A function $g(x) = x-1$.
3) Find the original function $(ƒ ∘ g)(x)$ that lies in $V_I$, but uses scalars from $V_{II}$.
4) Find the derivative of the composite function $(ƒ ∘ g)′(x)$ using limits.
5) Find the derivative of the compositor function $f(u)$.
6) Find the derivative of the substrate $g(x)$.
7) Evaluation of the L.H.S. and the R.H.S. of the _Leibniz's notation_ in a finite-state fashion, by multiplying
